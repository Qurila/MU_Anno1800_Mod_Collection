#Immigrants_And_Their_Fields_MU

This mod brings a new population into the game, the "immigrants".

They have no great demands and are mostly self-supporters.
They grow what they need to survive themselves with the ornamental fields they bring with them.

They are warmly welcomed and gladly offer their "peasant" labour.

There is room for up to 36 family members in their small huts. after all, they know each other :) .

They designed and built their public buildings themselves, and they are particularly proud of that.

Who knows, but maybe one or the other immigrant will discover his talent for the economy and open a place of work, who knows?
