#Green_Mile_MU

This mod contains all the trees and plants from City and Harbour_Ornaments and have been reworked.
To maintain the vanilla tree menu appearance for the ornaments, the Arctic and Enbesa have also received an ornaments tab.
I have added a separate mods tab.
This new menu may be used by other modders, and is basically desired, as long as it fits into this section.

The harbour objects are very difficult or impossible to remove with the remove tool from the build menu.
This is due to the fact that these objects do not have a ground decal so that they can freely choose the background, which will be added with future mods.

These objects can be removed by clicking on them and pressing the "Remove" key on the keyboard.

The attractiveness of the objects is set by mod to 2 points per object.
However, this value can be freely changed for each region with the ModManager IModYourAnno (https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases/latest).
