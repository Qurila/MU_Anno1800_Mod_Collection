#Worlds_New_Depots_MU



	Based on the industry dlc, this mod offers the possibility to build an upgradeable "storage" city with modified dockland modules.
	"Speicher"-city", and thus to create an "industrial district".
	It is possible to build depots on the land in the Old World, New World, Arctic and Enbesa, which can be upgraded in 3 steps.

	However, the active mod "New World Docklands" by @Lrds xormenter is required for this:

	Optically matching, 2 warehouses with a passage are included, which can also be upgraded in 3 steps.
	
	Everything is unlocked together with the storage city from the Docklands DLC.
	
	In the Old World you can select the desired skin with the brush from the building menu:
	
	- Docklands Original for the Old World
	- New World skin from the mod "New World Docklands".
	- Enbesa skin from the mod "New World Docklands".
	
	Since you cannot change a skin in the other sessions, only the skins from the mod "New World Docklands" are available in these sessions.
	
	For the Arctic, the texture from the "Winter" mod by @Lirvan was used.

	Since he also gave us the possibility to create them ourselves with his tools,
	to create them with his tools, I see no problem and thank him very much for that.
	I couldn't manage to create it myself :( .
	
	Furthermore, this mod brings with it an underground depot.
	Through the glass dome, you can observe what's happening underground.
	In the old world, you can select the desired skin from the building menu with the brush.
	You can choose from :
	
	- Adapted to Docklands for the Old World
	- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for the New World
	- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for Enbesa
	
	I have adapted the colours of the Arctic.
	
	
	The warehouses are identical to the vanilla building when upgraded:
	- LvL 1 has 2 loading ramps
	- Lvl 2 has 3 loading ramps
	- Lvl 3 has 4 loading ramps
	- Lvl 4 has 6 loading ramps
	
	The "Dockland" depots have the following storage capacities:
	- LvL 1 has 30t
	- LvL 2 has 65t
	- LvL 3 has 105t
	- LvL 4 has 150t
	
	The underground depots have a storage capacity of 30t per object and are not upgradeable.
	
	These values will be changed in the future with the final release of the Anno 1800 Mod Manager :
	https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno

	-in the New World at the Oberos, after the "Great Harbour
	-In the Arctic, with the Technicians, after the "Harbour
