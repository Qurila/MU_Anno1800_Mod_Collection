#Skyline_New_Era_MU

Skyscrapers now get the 3 existing skinpacks from Vibrant Citys in their full extent.
For technical reasons, changing the skins of the skyscrapers is only possible as a variation change, shift+V !
They always follow this pattern in the order:

- Original building ( no matter what height and composition )
- Brick" skin
- Nightlife" skin
- "Colourful" skin

this applies to all 7 possible skyscraper types, regardless of their height and composition.



In addition, this mod provides all department stores in skyscraper optics, which initially resemble a construction site.

- department stores'
- furniture store
- Drugstore


All department stores' heights and skins,can be changed via the skin system.

- Lvl 1 with 1 floor with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 2 with 2 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 3 with 3 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 4 with 4 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 5 with 5 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful

Recipes as well as the department stores are unlocked like the original.

The area of effect has been lowered from 45 to 25.
FullSatisfactionDistance and NoSatisfactionDistance have been halved.


Have fun with it wishes you your muggenstuermer ;)
